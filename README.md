# What is this?

This repository was originally intended to be a personal private place for my own notes and whatnot; but i've decided to make it public so the steam eagles project notebooks are visible to other people following the project.

# How to read the notes?

to read the notes properly you will need to follow the steps below
1. [download obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) if you don't already have obsidian installed
2. clone this repository to your machine (make sure you know the local folder path where it is cloned)
3. launch obsidian.  From the obsidian welcome menu, choose **Open folder as vault**
4. navigate to the repository and then choose the root folder named **Notebooks** and confirm
5. Obsidian will now be able to recognize the repo as a workspace and you can read the docs
