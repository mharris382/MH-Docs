What is NUnit
--
NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported fromÂ [JUnit](https://www.junit.org/), the current production release, version 3, has been completely rewritten with many new features and support for a wide range of .NET platforms.

NUnit is also part of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/)
