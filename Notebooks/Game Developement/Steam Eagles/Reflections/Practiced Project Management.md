#steam-eagles #reflections 

Due to the number of people on the team, we decided to try out [Codecks](https://curioshade.codecks.io/) as our PM tool.  We choose codecks because it was designed to be fun and motivating to use.  It actually worked really well, we were able to have one member of each department: Art, Programming, Sound accessing the board.  

The free version limits the number of users to 5.  Since we had 9 people, we had to limit access to the 3 programmers, 1 artists, and 1 sound designer.  

We stopped codecks after the jam ended but I would seriously consider using it again for the research project.
