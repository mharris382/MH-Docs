## What is a game jam?
for anybody who is unaware of what a game jam is here's the defintion from wikipedia


_[A game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam#cite_note-:0-1) is an event where participants try to make a [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game") from scratch. Depending on the format, participants might work independently, or in teams. The event duration usually ranges from 24 to 72 hours. Participants are generally programmers, game designers, artists, writers, and others in game development-related fields.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam#cite_note-2) While many game jams are run purely as a game-making exercise, some game jams are contests that offer prizes._

_[Traditionally, game jams focus on video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam#cite_note-Localizing_Game_Jam-3) however, [board games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game "Board game") have also been the [subject of game jams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam#cite_note-Global_Game_Jam-4)_

##### Additional Jam Rules
The rules stated that the majority of the project had to be made during that time period.  The rules also stated that the game must be made for a minimum of two players (i.e. can not be a singleplayer game).

I personally was not happy with the *game* we submitted, however I was very pleased with the *software* we made during the jam.  This was a fairly large team, which seems like a good idea on paper, but in practice requires significantly more teamwork skills, management, and organization.   The breakdown of the team is shown below.  

Dev Role | Number of team members
-------|----
Programming | 3
Art | 2
Music | 2
Audio/Sound Design | 2
Animation | 1


We built our game using the godot game engine (primarily because one of the other programmers wanted to use it).  However, this did present some problems for us during the jam.  Specifically, being the most experienced software engineer, and recognizing that the larger the team the more important organization; I suggested that we try to write keep our code as tidy as possible (while still being a game jam).  One of the two other programmers (while being a very talented programmer), lacked the necessary experience to work effectively in a team enviornment (they were also younger so this is completely reasonable).  Unfortunately this put additional pressure on myself, and taught me the following lesson.  

_it is not enough to know how to write good code to collaborate effectively, everyone has to know how to write good code._  If everyone doesn't write good code, those that do will have the added burden of either (1) not being able to use the other teammembers code, or (2) have to refactor someone elses code to make it maintainable.  In order to be an effective engineering lead one must know how to write good code AND be able to teach/_convince_ others to write good code.  It's also important to remember that you can't force somebody to do it if they don't want to, and in that case it's just better to not work with that person.  Learning how to recognize the difference between those unwilling to write good code and those who don't know how to write good code.  Those that don't know can learn, but those who are unwilling can not learn.  Figure out how to recognize the difference so you can judge if that person is a good teammate for you or not.

## Steam Eagles - Game Development 
- it is possible to create a puzzle which requires building a temporary structure which can be climbed by the transporter in order to reach materials which are out of reach. Once the blocks have been obtained, the transporter can then tear down the structure so the materials can be reclaimed.
- Players did not like floaty movements, both in terms of falling dynamic objects as well as character jumping

##### features we wanted to implement but did not have enough time for
- HUD
- Pause Menu
- Main Menu
- Different Types of Block 
	- Jump Block
- Platforming Hazards
