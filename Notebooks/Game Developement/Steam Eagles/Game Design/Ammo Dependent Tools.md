Ammo in this game currently refers only to blocks which the character's have picked up.  How the block is used will depend on the tool, however a fundamental rule (currently) is that matter must always be persevered.   Additionally all actions which consume blocks currently are reversable (in most cases).  That is to say that the player can undo any action (possibly with the aid from the other character).  If a block is placed, it can be picked back up again.  This will make the player feel much more confident about experimenting and trying new things, because they will *always* know that nothing they do will be permenant. 

Let me amend that statement.  The player should know that the only permenant actions *are the correct solutions.*   Once you solve the puzzle (even if not intentionally), the puzzle will not allow itself to become unsolved.  

Now this will certainly need to be _taught_ to the player with UI feedback, but once established it should make the player feel a lot safer about all their actions. If the deconstruct tool is not deconstructing a block, it's because you have already completed the puzzle, and it would not make sense (narratively speaking) for the character to re-break the puzzle for no reason.  

Pretty simple rule: _If you can break it, you are supposed to break it, if you can't break it you aren't supposed to break it._
