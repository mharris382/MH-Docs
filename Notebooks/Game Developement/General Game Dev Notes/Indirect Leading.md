#game-design 
This refers to decisions that level designers make to influence the choices the player makes without directly telling or forcing them to make those choices. One of my favorite examples is in Dark Souls. After first bonfire, they intentionally led the players in the wrong direction towards enemies which were higher level then the player. They wanted to have the player die a bunch of times right off the bat. The designers accomplished this by placing the correct path off to the side, and the path where they wanted the players to go (to the skeletons) was surrounded by a large ruin, an archway, and a flight of stairs.
