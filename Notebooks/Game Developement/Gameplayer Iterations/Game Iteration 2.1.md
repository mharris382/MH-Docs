# Goal 
joke about alan and collectors who collect stuff.  Joke is that collecters create value by forming a collection.  The fact that it is a collection of something, gives it value, the larger the collection the more value.  So we see someone admiring their collection of old coins, next to them we see someone admiring their collection of toilet bowl cleaners.
