it's 9:57 am, I didn't sleep super well because I was stressing about the meeting I have today with Robert Weis.  I'm very afraid he will tell me there is absolutely no way this project is possible.   Although tbh I feel like that is somewhat unlikely, or at least he would not have gotten my hopes up by saying it is possible, albeit very very difficult.  But if I was afraid of difficult things I wouldn't be involved in game developement.

I'm currently waiting for the meeting to start.  I'm excited but also tired and nervous.  I feel like I definetly need some coffee for this meeting.  I wanted to plan what I was going to say, but I really don't know what I'm supposed to say.  I really need this to work out.  Should I call him Robert or Professor Weis?? I'm not sure, I'm an adult now so it feels weird to call another adult by such a formal name.  On the other hand I don't want to offend him by speaking to informally.  I think it's probably best to air on the safe side and call him Professor Weis.

I will show him the work I've done probably.
