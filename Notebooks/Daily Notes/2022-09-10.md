#daily-entry 


11:00 AM
- woke up for second time

1:00 PM
- watched the first half of guardians of the galaxy

2:00 PM
- tried to make progress with picking up the legos but I believe I just made things worse.  It is not realistic to separate all those legos by hand, it would just take too long.  You could do it, but it would take an incredibly long amount of time for something that would end up getting mixed up.  Steph is right, the only practical way to pick up **AND** sort the legos would be to build a contraption that automatically sorts the legos by size.  That could be made though, I should ask steph if it's a good idea.

2:45 PM
- decided i had better start working on my gas simulation, that way I have an update for Anshul when he gets back to me.  I should also ask him for an update.

3:33 PM
Female Cardnal just knocked on the window again (this time the study window above the stairwell)


4:00 PM
ate a quesadilla
took a shower
tried to pick up legos again because I forgot it was pointless.  Stopped doing that afterwards.

5:00 PM
cleaned up the kitchen and pantry from last night (water leak)

5:30 PM
messaged riko 

5:45 PM
regretted messaging riko

5:48 PM
editted messages to riko

5:49 PM
decided to stop worrying about messages to riko

6:46 PM
[[Gas Sim Pt.5.3.x|created formal entry documenting today's findings on the gas simulation]]
_seealso: ![[GasSim_Pt.5.3.1_Happy-Accident.mp4]]_

6:51 PM
still waiting for Anshul to fill out the form.  _see: [[2022-09-09]]_


7:00 PM
not sure what exactly I should do.  I have a lot more videos of this project than I usually do, which is really awesome because it is a documentation of my progress up to this point.  Really interesting to see it all layed out like that.![[Pasted image 20220910185308.png]]

anyway not sure what I should do now.  There are a number of possible directions I could take.  I think possibly transitioning the 128px grid over to C# could be a good idea.  Ideally while transfering it, I could identify the parts which need to be adjusted so that the whole system works with any grid resolution.  I'll need the code from my previous iteration for that however, and I'm not sure exactly where it is.  I should check the commit history of other branches to find it.  I can probably pull a lot of that code directly instead of rewritting it entirely, **so long as I know what I'm pulling it should be fine**.  I'll look though the commit logs to find the files I need.    Some of the code i'm looking for may actually be in gdscript, I can't remember if it was all C# or a mixture.  I'm fairly certain there was some c# code in there.


- [ ] Search for multi-res simulation code that I would like to reuse.
