- **[[Game Designer]]**: responsible for coming up with game mechanics, User Interface Design, User Experience Design, balancing and expanding existing mechanics, world building
- **[[Software Engineer]]**: lead programmer, responsible for major software architectural decisions, choosing/creating software tools for team members to use, creates specifications for programming languages, programming conventions, and balances speed with scalability
- **[[Project Manager]]**: organizes and prioritizes workload, delegates tasks, acts as a liason between different departments and tries to keep the production working towards a cohesion goal.  
- **3D-2D [[Technical Artist]]**: responsible for making all the art assets functional and looking good within the software.  Also responsible for writing gpu code (called shaders) used for creating materials which are used to render everything from special effects to UI. 
Other Positions (Supplemental Roles)
--
- **[[Character Rigging]]**:  the technical process wich is necessary to be able to animate a character.  The format differs for 3D and 2D characters, however both require rigging to produce high quality results
-**[[Storytelling & Script Writer]]**: One of the [[Learning Objectives & Goals|learning objectives]] is to experiment with different ways of integrating gameplay and storytelling, which will most likely require some writing (particularly because I would like to focus on the use of language/dialogue within the gameplay experience) 
- **[[Supporting Artist]]**: I enjoy drawing and modeling in my free time, so I will most likely apply that skillset to produce additional art assets that are needed.  Particular when I think 3D modeling may be helpful, since the other artists are less experienced with 3D modeling. 


To offer assistance, guidance, and support for the student to get the most out of this educational and professional opportunity.


In addition to the listed deliverables, each milestone should produce at least 1 design documentation artifact (Dev logs, research report, design document) as well as a paper/document outlining what was learned during this milestone (what went well? what could have gone better? What will we do differently in the next iteration)

Organization, Project Managment & Leadership Skills: learn to manage time, resources, and individuals


---

develop the game jam software prototype into to a published Steam Eagles prototype/demo 
- the beginning of the project should have more rapid prototyping cycles.  Maintanence cyles should increase in frequency and/or duration as the project develops.  However if these maintanence cycles must not impede project development.  Learning to balance these inherently contradictory tasks should be one of the main learning objectives of the entire project.

- multidisciplinary collaborator(s): artist/animator/sound/programmer/writer
- discord and codecks (project management platform for game development)

Math/Computation Skills: Develop Cellular Automata to create "physically inspired" compressible gas simulation to be used in gameplay




1. reflect on the results of the game jam (and gameplay changes since then) 
2. rapidly iterate mechanics from game jam prototype, either inside Unity or Godot
3. refactor successful prototypes into modular software components which can be combined with each other to enable rapid feature experimentation and exponential growth with the game's "space of possibility"
4. over the course of the entire project there should be a minimum of 5 playable gameplay iterations which utilize the code, art, and assets created during the game jam.
Extra Credit: research the feasibility of P2P networked multiplayer support allowing play testers to play with each other remotely 



- artists consisting of ideally at least: 1 artist or animator, 1 sound designer or musician. 
- Godot/Unity, Photoshop, Blender, Substance Designer

- integrate short dialogues sequences seamlessly into the steam eagles gameplay experience which progresses the plot without disrupting the player's gameplay engagement or flow.  
- utilize art, sounds, and music to contribute to the story through environmental storytelling
- iterate on "rule tiles" art styles and document asset creation techniques (there currently does not exist a streamlined workflow for the creation of rule tiles)

- Share progress updates in a way that engages the community and attracts others into the world of steam eagles
-  During each development iteration publish a multimedia developer log documenting and explaining the process that was taken.  
- provide development documentation and guidelines that allow other collaborators to work more independently 
- document results of each iteration, reflect on what was learned, and decide how to proceed using the new knowledge.  include code snippets, videos, screen captures, links, or demos 
- Determine what (if any) larger lessons can be extrapolated from this knowledge
