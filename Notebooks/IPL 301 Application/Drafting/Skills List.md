#project 
Design Skills
--
- experiment with possible technics for creating fun emergent gameplay and puzzles using interactive grids, dynamic objects, platforming, and unique fluid mechanics


Software Development Skills
--
- taking a software prototype all the way to a polished end result
- practice agile, rapid iteration, test-driven development
- alternate between cycles of speed, feature experimentation, rapid prototyping and cycles of self-assessment, code refactoring, reorganizing, and maintaining software so as to remaining agile even as the project grows.  
	- the beginning of the project should have more rapid prototyping cycles.  Maintanence cyles should increase in frequency and/or duration as the project develops.  However if these maintanence cycles must not impede project development.  Learning to balance these inherently contradictory tasks should be one of the main [[Learning Objectives & Goals|learning objectives]] of the entire project.
- Cross-engine scripting backend for buisness logic
- co-op P2P networking using godot or unity using steamworks API or similar networking server backend, for user authentication and matchmaking, as well as cloud saves.
- local split-screen co-op, LAN multiplayer, P2P Networked multiplayer (NO DEDICATED SERVER NEEDED)


Mathematics and Computation Skills
--
- fluid simulation theory and differential equations
- physically based or physically inspired simulation technical
- optimize the non-trivial computational problem of simulating both compressible and incompressible fluids (in 2D)
- cellular automata


Leadership and Organization Skills
--
- collaborating with other programmers and developers around the world remotely 
- maintain a development schedule in order to meet self established deadlines and remain agile
- provide development documentation and guidelines that allow other collaborators to work more independently 
- creating _useful_ software documentation for other developers to use


Creative and Art skills
--
- creative writing and storytelling: narrative structure, character development, scripted and interactive dialogues, cinematics in 2D
- level design, puzzle design, world building, enviornmental storytelling
- ability to create seamless integration between story and gameplay
- UI design, typeography
