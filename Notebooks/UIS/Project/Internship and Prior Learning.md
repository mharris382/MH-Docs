For some students, it is possible to do a Project instead of a traditional internship. The Project is very independent in nature, requiring good organizational skills and attention to self-imposed deadlines. Projects should relate to your major and must be approved by both the **student’s department** and **an IPL Coordinator**.


Examples of a Project include, but are not limited to:

-   [a research project with a faculty member at UIS](https://www.uis.edu/2021-ipl/project/uis-research-project-opportunities) or another institution,
-   a writing project (fiction or nonfiction),
-   an entrepreneurial endeavor such as starting a business,
-   an audit of a nonprofit organization’s computer system, and
-   the creation of new software or a new app.
