Other Positions (Supplemental Roles)
--
- **Character Rigging**:  the technical process wich is necessary to be able to animate a character.  The format differs for 3D and 2D characters, however both require rigging to produce high quality results
-**Storytelling/Script Writer**: One of the [[Learning Objectives & Goals|learning objectives]] is to experiment with different ways of integrating gameplay and storytelling, which will most likely require some writing (particularly because I would like to focus on the use of language/dialogue within the gameplay experience) 
- **Artist**: I enjoy drawing and modeling in my free time, so I will most likely apply that skillset to produce additional art assets that are needed.  Particular when I think 3D modeling may be helpful, since the other artists are less experienced with 3D modeling.
