Learning Objectives
==
- Improve my ability to develop gameplay through quick iteration cycles, rapid prototyping, and playtesting.  
	- Study the feasibility of decoupling a game's *buisness-logic* from the game engine.  
- Apply advanced graph/tree algorithms covered in CSC Algorithms and Computation towards the goal of creating emmergent, intuitive gameplay mechanics.   Specifically mecahnics which revolve around discrete macro-scale gas simulations.
- Study and experiment with fluid algorithms for rendering and gameplay.
	- Fluid simulations are one of the most computationally difficult simulations to simulate with physical accuracy
		- applies to both 2D and 3D but 3D is often computationally unfeasable and requires certain tricks to simplify the computation
- Discover ways the macro-scale gas simulation can be applied to creating engaging puzzle.   
- Practice ability to iterate on separate parts of the game in parallel, in particular storytelling and gameplay.

Goals
==
- Develop a modular, engine agnostic C# class library, which decouples the system's core logic from any particular development tool (like Unity or Godot)
	- The fluid simualtion should be an independent module with easy to use C# interfaces that make the library easy to use in either Godot or Unity.
- Develop a godot adapter module for testing and game development
- Produce a final product by the end of the semester which fulfills one or all of these requirements
	- build a short game demo which provides enough of a vertical slice to attract investment to turn the project into a full length game
	- build recent, polished content for my own personal portfolio, that demostrate not only my programming ability and technical skills but my creative abilities as well (which are harder to sell on paper)
- Collaborate with other aspiring game development students in other parts of the world; gaining international relationships and practicing communication skills (especially with those who speak english as a second language, which I've found to be rather common)
