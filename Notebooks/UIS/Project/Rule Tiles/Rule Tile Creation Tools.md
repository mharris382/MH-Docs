Problem: rule tiles are extremely useful, and help speed up iteration times for level design, playtesting, and game design.  Without rule tiles the level's art elements and the level's physical layout are fundamentally tied together.  


It may be easier to understand the impact by actually seeing the difference from the perspective of a level designer.  It's also important to remember that game developement relies on rapid iteration and player testing.  Level design is no exception.  

Level design is really the process of taking all the separate pieces produced from each department: art, technology, game design, and story; and combining those pieces into a single cohesive experience.  Without the level designer, all we have is a bunch of disconnected code, art, and story.  In video games, levels are usually procedural generated by algorithms or hand-crafted by designers.  Each approach has it's own advantages and disavantages.  While the intention of this project is to create tools that make it easier for both artists and level designers to create hand-crafted levels faster and more easily; the tools will almost certainly apply to both methods; in fact it's more common to see these tools used in procedurally generated levels than hand-crafted levels.  It's reasonable to assume that this is because the computer needs to know how to generate a level that looks good to the player.  Additionally rule tiles are often used in games where the player is able to place tiles in the world, such as terraria.  

Rule tiles makes it easier for the person who is building something within the world, by removing the *how* from the *what*.  In terraria, the player only needs to think about what![[Pasted image 20220830220500.png]]

below you can see how the clay tile changes the texture based on the surrounding tiles.  The tile itself did not change, only the neighbors changed.  This particular rule is that dirt and clay should only be visually connected when at least 2 tiles of the same type are connected.  the right image shows the clay block with only 1 clay neighbor and 2 dirt neighbors, while the left image has 2 clay neighbors and 1 dirt neighbor

if another clay block is added below the block in question, the rule will choose a dirt connected corner because the block has two clay neighbors (3 if you include corners).

here we can see what happens when the clay block has no clay neighbors

from a computer science perspective this mentally separates the art from the level.  The physical shape of the level can be modified by the designer (or in this case the player), without needing to know what the result needs to look like.   

With rule tiles adding a tunnel just invoves erasing solid blocks where the tunnel should be. The same task without rule tiles involves erasing solid blocks, *and then* manually replacing all the edges and corner blocks to the appropriate texture.  If the designer wants to test the shape, but not go through the tedium of replacing the tiles, they will have to be able to imagine what the new level looks like rather than instantly seeing the result as soon as they make the change.  

In a game like terraria, rule tiles are an absolute necessity. Without them the game would be tedious and not fun, and players just wouldn't play the game.  However, the process of making these tiles is rather difficult and it essentially makes the artists/programmers job more tedious and difficult so that the level designer's job is less tedious and difficult.  We would like a way for artists to easily make many different rule tiles for different kinds of rules.  Furthermore, it would be extremely useful to be able to store the rule tile configurations externally, and be able to import them into various development enviornements.  Currently, if you want to move your rule tiles from Godot to Unity, you can move the texture; but the meta-data that stores the rules will need to be reauthored using Unity.  Since the logic and configuration is identical, it should be fairly simple to write an engine plugin for both godot and unity; which converts externally stored rule tile data into the engine equivalent data structure.  

Additionally, data stored externally is much safer than data stored and managed by a game engine; because that data is accessed by so many different systems at different types.
