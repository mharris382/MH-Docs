term used to describe a computer simulation made for the purpose of facilitating emergent gameplay while leveraging the human brain's intuition about the behavior of physical matter.  We say physically inspired, because the idea is to create fun gameplay while capturing enough of the true physical behavior so that the gameplay is more accessible to players.
