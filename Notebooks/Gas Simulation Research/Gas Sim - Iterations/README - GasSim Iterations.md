This notebook contains record of each development iteration for the gas simulation.

Design Concepts which are not ready for prototyping should go in [[README - GasSim Planning]]


Each Record should have the following sections:
- **Goal/Motivation**
	- what was the purpose of this iteration
- Process (optional)
- **Results**
	- Video of result
	- Code Snippets
- **Reflection**
	- what was learned?
	- where to go next?
