# Iteration 10: Sinks
previous iteration: [[GasSim Iteration 9]]
next iteration: [[GasSim Iteration 11]]

# Goal 
would like to experiment with the idea of creating air currents by having source and sink in the same area.  We currently only have sources putting gas into the simulation.  We now need to add sinks to pull gas out of the simulation.


### Question Statement
Question: how can we integrate the concept of air sinks into the simulation
Hypothesis: Should be pretty similar to the source code (as in the gas source)
