# Goal
Reflect on behavoiur of previous iterations.  Since i have been busy and distracted getting enrolled in IPL-301 and hadn't messed around with the fluid sim for a couple days.  Additionally I had been attempting to convert this into c# but it was the first time I had used C# with godot so it took a few attempts to understand it.  I think I've got that worked out now, which is great since C# is my best programming language.  I'd like to transition to c# for most of my fluid si
- [x] learn how to use C# with godot

Hypothesis: I need to add diagnal movement as a backup option when can't find anywhere to move in adjacent cells
