Notebooks-Overview
==
*A single Obsidian workspace that will from now on, serve as my one and only storage location for all useful knowledge I acquire. *

Justification for creating this notebook: I am good at doing research and good at remembering things I did in the past; however I could improve my ability to use and recall knowledge even better if I had all my notes organized.  I take notes quite often, however I do not have a single reliable location for these notes.  Some of them are inside OneNote, some in the cloud, some scattered in various obscure directories on my laptop or my PC.  Finding and using these notes is fairly impossible, and often times I just do the research again to remember.  However that is very inefficient and by having a single location which is also a git repository I can sync my notes on various machines, back them up in the cloud, and keep my notes organized in one central location.  I'm choosing obsidian because I really like it for notetaking and markdown is extremely lightweight and platform agnostic.

Note to self: I will need to make sure to use this notebook and take care of it.  Additionally I will often take notes on paper, I should try to scan and upload those notes to google drive and then add them to this workspace.  Eventually I can have them transcribed by an AI,  but lets start with just remembering to add them to this repository.
